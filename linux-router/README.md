# hassio-router
This is a home assistant addon built on top of the linux-router from https://github.com/garywill/linux-router.

It uses its extensive script to bringup an access point, with several customizations and configurations possible, as provided by the linux-router project.
## Installation

```

### Configuration

The available configuration options are as bellow. Make sure to edit
according to your needs:

```
{
    "ssid": "WIFI_NAME",
    "passphrase": "WIFI_PASS",
    "channel": "0",
    "address": "192.168.2.1",
    "interface": ""
    "allow_internet": false
    "hide_ssid": false
    "ban_priv": true
}

```
When channel set to 0, it will automatically find the best channel.

When the `interface` option is left blank, a list with the detected wlan interfaces will be printed on the logs and the addon will terminate. Set the correct `interface` value on the configuration then restart the addon. `ban_priv` is true by default preventing access point clients from accessing private addresses.
